Files are in the below google drive. I wasn't able to upload to github because of the size. Files are less than 100 MB after compressed.

Files in the fiolder

ged181.csv - This is the even database file

PRIO-GRID Static Variables.csv - This is the static grid variable file

Next three are temporal files. Since the file size is huge I had to download it as three parts from the PRIO GRID database 3. 8. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables.csv 4. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables_1.csv 5. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables_2.csv

These three are the data dictionaries which I use to select and define features. This data dictionaly act as the driving files to select features from other files

temporal_data_dict.csv
events_data_dict.csv
static_data_dict.csv

Final findings.

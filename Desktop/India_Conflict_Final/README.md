Files in the fiolder

1. ged181.csv  - This is the even database file

2. PRIO-GRID Static Variables.csv  - This is the static grid variable file

Next three are temporal files. Since the file size is huge I had to download it as three parts from the PRIO GRID database
3. 8. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables.csv
4. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables_1.csv
5. PRIO-GRID Yearly Variables_2.csv

These three are the data dictionaries which I use to select and define features. This data dictionaly act as the driving files to select features from other files

6. temporal_data_dict.csv
7. events_data_dict.csv
8. static_data_dict.csv
